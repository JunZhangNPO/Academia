- Read the person's CV and latest paper when you plan to meet him/her.
  - If you have time, also read their Twitter.

- Google the basic knowledge of the country if you are going to meet someone from a less well-known country.
  - Do the same for universities and institutions.
  - It would be better if you know some fun facts, such as Syracuse is called "snow city"

- Ask good questions
   - Ask questions that start with "why" and "how," which are open-ended; use fewer "whether/if" and "do," which are close-ended.

- Have the mindset that you are going to do fieldwork.

- Make notes after the meeting.

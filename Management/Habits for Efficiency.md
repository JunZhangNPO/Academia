**No mobile phone while you are working.**
- Put it at home while you work at the library.
- Work at a place with no internet connection, particularly for reading and writing activities.
- Work while you are flying. My most efficient experiences are working on the plane.

**Talk about your research**
- Even on dating apps, which will help you realize whether your story is fascinating.
- Give a sentence with a question, variables, methods, and conclusion. Do not provide just a noun indicating topics.

**Work in a healthy way**
- Many libraries provide height-adjustable tables.
- Walk around after 30 minutes of work.

**Allow space to think**
- For example, taking a shower is a good opportunity to think about your work.
- You do not need much information. Instead, you need to digest information well.
- Write notes promptly when you get an idea.

**Do things immediately**
- Send email (when you promise someone to send an email)
- Show the literature: For example, when a student asks, "Could you please tell me specifically what paper you referred to?" Google it immediately. Do not say, "Send me an email to remind me," as this creates a burden for both you and the student.
- Send the meeting memo after the meeting.

**Effective Communication**
- meet in person/video/audio, which is better than email, particular when you want to have a deep discussion

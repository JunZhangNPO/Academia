### **Only Read + Highlight + Make Notes**

- Focus on the reading
- Highlight important things
- Make notes

### **Recall it**

- When you walk home or have nothing to do, recall what you have read.
- Summarize information in an Excel sheet; you can compare your summary and AI's.
- Share the conclusion or the exciting point with others.
  - For example, when a colleague asks how you are, you can respond: "I just read a paper about..."

### **Read for Application**

- Do not read much at one time.
- Read with a purpose (for example, the methodology part is going to help you).
- Read and then teach.

Local Public Safety Coordinating Councils

https://www.oregon.gov/cjc/jri/pages/lpscc.aspx

In 1995, Senate Bill 1145 required every county to convene a Local Public Safety Coordinating Council (LPSCC). 
While LPSCCs across the state engage in a variety of activities to improve system-wide communication and collaboration, their primary purpose is to:
- Coordinate local criminal justice policy and planning;
- Make recommendations to the county board of commissioners regarding the use of state and county resources to supervise local offenders;
- And since 2014, develop and approve their countyâ€™s Justice Reinvestment Grant program.

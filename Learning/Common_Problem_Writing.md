Based on the suggestions I have received previously, there are some common problems I often encounter in academic writing:

### 1. Expandable and Generalized Statements
- Making arguments without providing evidence.
- Tending to include normative writing.

### 2. Misuse of Citations
- Missing page numbers for direct citations.
- Citing irrelevant works.
- Misunderstanding the original work.
- Using shallow citations (relying on abstracts without thoroughly reading the work).

### 3. Language Issues
- Lack of coherence between sentences.
- Overuse of passive tense.

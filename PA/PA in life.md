# Understand Administrative Burden, NY State, June, 2024

I lost my SSN and needed to replace it. Although I have experience in applying for an SSN, I still felt an administrative burden during this process.  

First, I needed to search online to determine which documents I should provide. Initially, I mistakenly looked up the documents required for citizens. These documents were unfamiliar to me, which made me notice the button for "non-citizen."  

What's more, I needed to collect and print these materials. Additionally, I had to take an Uber downtown, where the federal building is located. This process costs both time and money.  

Only when I arrived did I learn about the option of an online social security account. It would have been time-saving if I had scheduled an appointment online.  

Additionally, as a non-citizen, an international student, and someone unfamiliar with the local government, I felt nervous when communicating with officials. I carefully watched his face; whenever he frowned, I wondered if I had missed any documents. Was my English clear enough?  

For those with low education and low income, how much administrative burden do they face when interacting with the government?

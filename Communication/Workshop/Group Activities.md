I am attending ICPSR, a program for methodology training. It is wonderful but could be better if the group activities were improved.

Participants are classmates and have limited opportunities to communicate with each other. Usually, people sit with someone similar to them, making it difficult to go out of their comfort zone without external push.

I think the program can initiate a mini-conference, with participants introducing their work in five minutes. For example, panels on voting behavior, health economics, etc.

To save time, this mini-conference can be held at noon and run in parallel sessions.


Tidy Tuesday is good format. However, it is mainly a lecture while lacks interaction among students. 


All participants, including previous sessions, are in the same slack channel, mkaing it difficult to interact with each other. 

It would be better if there is a link that could show the bio of each participant, which can help us connect with participants who share similar interests. 

Check the technology before the class. There are some technological issues with classrooms. 

Include more new methods and expand them to non-political science field. I feel the program is really political science focused while not many students and instructors from other disciplines.

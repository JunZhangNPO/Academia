I am attending ICPSR, a program for methodology training. It is wonderful but could be better if the group activities were improved.

Participants are classmates and have limited opportunities to communicate with each other. Usually, people sit with someone similar to them, making it difficult to go out of their comfort zone without external push.

I think the program can initiate a mini-conference, with participants introducing their work in five minutes. For example, panels on voting behavior, health economics, etc.

To save time, this mini-conference can be held at noon and run in parallel sessions.


Tidy Tuesday is good format. However, it is mainly a lecture while lacks interaction among students.

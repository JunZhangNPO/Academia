## Meeting Navigation 

### What I Learned from Prof. Lewis Faulk 

I am in the Nonprofit Management Leadership Early Career Fellow Program. We need to have several virtual meetings, mainly about research presentations and discussions. Prof. Lewis Faulk, the host of this fellowship, is really good at navigating this kind of academic meeting. I summarized what I learned from him.

**First, put the agenda at the beginning.**  
He writes a detailed agenda in the chat at the beginning, including the time and specific activities. This way, participants have a clear idea about what they should do and when.

**Second, update the agenda promptly.**  
Sometimes we talk a little longer than planned. When this happens, he updates the agenda with new times in the chat to remind the following participants to be mindful of the time.

**Third, no waste of public time.**  
For example, if one subgroup discusses longer than expected in their breakout room while others have already come back to the main room, this subgroup might need another 5 minutes. Prof. Faulk then asks the other participants to take a break instead of waiting in the main room.

**Additionally, he always provides specific information.**  
When he mentions an article and suggests participants read it, he puts the link in the chatbox. This way, everyone knows exactly which article to read. Otherwise, we might search for the wrong article and spend a lot of time finding an unfamiliar one.

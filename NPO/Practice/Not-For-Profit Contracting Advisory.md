- Popularity of a business-like mindset: best practices, quantification, customer focus, standardization  
- Close connections with academia: administrative burden, informed decision-making, data-driven approaches, agile methods, survey research  
- Some committee members are very active, while others remain silent  
- Information exchange occurs (e.g., about funding opportunities)

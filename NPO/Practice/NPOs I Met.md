It is a super good way to promote organ donation.

Tourists can donate money immediately 
But it could be better if there is an online channel for donation, becasue not many people have enough cash

# 4. Good Collaboration Between Nonprofits and Businesses  

- When I used Instacart to buy groceries, I received a message saying, **"Donate groceries & essentials to LA Fire Relief."**  
- This initiative is tied to recent news, which helps build a connection by reminding people that others need essential supplies just like I do.  
- The simplicity of the process makes it easy to take action.

- **Add Notes:**
  - Write notes in a separate column to indicate missing data or relevant information.

- **Highlight Rows:**
  - Highlight the first and last rows when working with multiple data points, such as in correlation analysis.
  - This approach can help you not put data in the row of next paper   

- **Summarize Papers Using ChatGPT:**
  - Upload the paper to ChatGPT and ask it to summarize variables and methods. 
  - This approach helps you quickly check whether the paper meets the criteria and gather additional information.
  - Use ChatGPT to extract information such as correlation analysis. This eliminates the need to copy values manually, enabling you to populate a whole column efficiently. 
  - **Note:** Be cautious about incorrect values provided by ChatGPT. Double-check all outputs.

- **Check the following details carefully:**
  - Whether it is a coefficient or odds ratio.
  - Whether it is a standard error or t-value.

-**How to Count N:**
  - For correlation analysis, if N is mentioned, use that value.
  - If N is not mentioned, check the previous descriptive analysis.
  - Use the key variable as the benchmark and compare N with other variables. 
    - If N is smaller than the benchmark, use the smaller value.
    - If N is larger than the benchmark, use the benchmark.
   
- **Count Variables Accurately:**
  - When calculating the number of variables, pay attention to year dummies. These represent multiple variables, not just one.

- **Excel Tip for Relationship Direction:**
  - Use this Excel function to get the direction of a relationship based on the coefficient or correlation (r):  
    `=TEXT(Cell, "+;-")`  
    Example: `=TEXT(BB232, "+;-")`
    
  - **Handle Year Columns:**
  - When working with a column containing years, do not drag down directly, as the numbers may change. Instead, copy a row and then drag down.

- **Save Documents:**
  - Save the original document (with title information) in different folders categorized by outcome variables.

- **Manage References:**
  - Save the DOI in Zotero for organized referencing.

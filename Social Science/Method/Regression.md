Weighted Seemingly Unrelated Regression
(Martin and Smith, 2005)

Seemingly Unrelated Regression is a system regression estimator which jointly estimates multiple models. 
This allows joint hypothesis testing of parameters across models since the parameter covariance is robust to correlation of residuals across models. 
It can also lead to more precise parameter estimates if some residuals are conditionally homoskedastic and regressors differ across equations.

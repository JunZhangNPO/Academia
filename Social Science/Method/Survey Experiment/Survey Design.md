### Guidelines for Survey Design

1. **Avoid adding too many questions in one block.**  
   - One to three questions per block is ideal.

2. **Keep questions simple and clear.**  
   - Avoid asking participants to perform calculations.

3. **Measure concepts directly.**  
   - Ensure the questions address the intended metrics explicitly.

4. **Clarify each option.**  
   - For example, define what "median" means if used as an option.

5. **Avoid logical conflicts.**  
   - Ensure that no options or questions contradict each other.

6. **Make the survey engaging.**  
   - Participants should find the treatment interesting; avoid including boring elements.

7. **Include a "Not sure" option for manipulation checks.**  

8. **Conduct a pilot test.**  
   - The pilot should focus mainly on the treatment, such as six key questions, rather than the entire survey.

9. **Test with a normal participant.**  
   - Ask a participant what they think about while answering each question to ensure clarity and relevance.

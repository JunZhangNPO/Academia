be a likable person 
mainly show your work but not yourself 
use one slide to show your agenda 

get someone professional to polish your slides 


get feedback from marketplace and make changes 

frame RQ in a more open way 

show the figure for your argument 


the mindset of decision maker 

Literature review matters least

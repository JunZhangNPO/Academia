# Exploring Social Science Concepts Through Stand-up Comedy: Institutional Trust and Transaction Costs

I watched Trevor Noah’s stand-up comedy routine about New York City’s traffic lights. He humorously pointed out that pedestrians in NYC tend to trust the traffic lights implicitly. They often cross the street when the light turns green, regardless of whether vehicles are speeding down the road.  

However, the situation is quite different in Africa. People there generally don’t rely on or trust traffic lights as much. Instead, they view traffic lights more as suggestions and may not strictly adhere to them.

Trevor’s show not only provided laughs but also touched on significant concepts in social science. Trust in traffic lights reflects a broader trust in institutions and the rules established by authorities. This trust is crucial for well-functioning institutions. Despite the potential risks involved, both drivers and pedestrians understand their roles, reducing overall risk and transaction costs.  

On the flip side, when people lack trust in institutions, even if the institutions exist, they may not operate effectively. This leads individuals to rely on their own judgment and require more cognitive activities, potentially risking their safety and increasing transaction costs.  

Moving beyond the comedic lens, social scientists should observe real-world dynamics. While Trevor’s observations about NYC pedestrians mostly align with reality, my personal experience adds nuance. During my time in NYC, I noticed that pedestrians often follow the green light but may occasionally cross on red as well. This suggests that institutional functioning isn’t flawless. Indeed, this phenomenon can be explained by practical considerations. The high volume of pedestrians and relatively low vehicle speeds can create a situation where the benefits of crossing safely during a red light outweigh the potential costs or risks. Additionally, drivers in such areas anticipate pedestrian crossings regardless of traffic light signals. However, it definitely increases the total risk faced by people compared to strictly following the traffic lights.  

In conclusion, Trevor Noah’s comedic take on New York’s traffic lights offers a window into broader social science concepts, highlighting the complex interplay between institutional trust, behavior, and real-world dynamics.

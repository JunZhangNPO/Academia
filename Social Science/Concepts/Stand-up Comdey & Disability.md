I watched a stand-up comedy performance by a Chinese actor named Heideng (黑灯). He is blind and makes many jokes related to disability issues. For example, he mentioned that there are eight million blind people in China but only 200 seeing-eye dogs available. Although these dogs should be allowed to enter public areas, people often have misunderstandings and concerns.

He also made jokes about poorly constructed blind tracks. For instance, some blind tracks are erratic and lead to dead ends.

I love stand-up comedy because it usually helps us see the ironic aspects of life, often related to policies.

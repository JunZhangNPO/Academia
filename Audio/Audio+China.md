## Abstract

Existing studies on authoritarian propaganda focus on cognitive propaganda, authoritarian states’ information manipulation aiming to alter citizens’ rational political choices in favor of the regime. However, few studies have systematically examined authoritarian rulers’ strategies in emotional propaganda: political cues aiming to alter citizens’ irrational part of political attitudes — emotions. In this paper, we describe and explain the prevalence of emotional propaganda in authoritarian China using a novel audio-as-data approach. We collect original audio-visual recordings from *Xinwen Lianbo*, a flagship news program on China Central Television (CCTV). We construct audio-based measures of emotional arousal, vocal pitch, from the state-sponsored news program as measures of the intensity of the state’s effort in emotional propaganda. Our preliminary findings suggest three patterns of China’s strategic use of emotional propaganda. 

First, vocal pitch is positively correlated with enthusiasm in the text transcripts of news. Second, a higher vocal pitch is used to report on critical political news including the COVID-19 pandemic, the leadership, and political mobilization. Third, vocal pitch demonstrates considerable variation over time and peaks around important political events. This paper has both theoretical and methodological contributions to the study of political communication in authoritarian China.

# Emotional Propaganda: Understanding Authoritarian Affective Manipulation with an Audio-as-Data Approach to Chinese State Media During the COVID-19 Outbreak

**Haohan Chen (The University of Hong Kong)**

## Abstract

Authoritarian regimes use propaganda for two purposes: changing minds and changing hearts. Existing works focus on the former, extensively analyzing how propaganda indoctrinates or threatens the population while overlooking the latter, propaganda for states’ strategic affective manipulation, namely, emotional propaganda. We theorize that authoritarian states employ emotional propaganda to preclude public grievances that undermine authoritarian control. We test the theory by applying an audio-as-data approach to China’s propaganda on state-run media during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. We collect original audio-visual recordings of China’s most-viewed daily evening news program, Xinwen Lianbo, during the period. We construct audio-based measures, including vocal pitch, speech rates, genders of speakers, and speaking modes, as indicators of the state’s strategic emotional propaganda. We pair them with daily reports of COVID-19 cases and social media sentiments about COVID-19 to examine how the state strategically deployed emotional propaganda as a response to the public health crisis and public grievances it caused. Our study provides the first systematic analysis of emotional propaganda, an important propaganda strategy of authoritarian regimes. Methodologically, we highlight the unique advantages of the audio-as-data approach in detecting emotions and apply this emerging computational tool to the study of comparative political communication.

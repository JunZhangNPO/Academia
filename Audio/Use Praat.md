### Introduction 

- Use this software to conduct basic analysis on audio data.
- Praat is a speech synthesis program that estimates the fundamental frequency by dividing the autocorrelation of a windowed signal by
the autocorrelation of the window itself (Dietrich, Enos, & Sen, 2019).
- In order to analyze a speech signal Praat has to “cut up the sound into small segments and analyse each interval separately
and pretend it has constant characteristics” (Weenink 2012, 21).

### Procedure

1. **Download the software**
   [Praat](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/)

2. **Watch the Tutorial Videos**
   [LinguistikLabor Albert-Ludwigs-Universität](https://www.youtube.com/@linguistiklaboralbert-ludw3514)
   
   Although there are some manuals that can also help you learn the software, such as those provided on the [Praat manuals by others](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manualsByOthers.html) webpage, I think video tutorials are easier to understand.
